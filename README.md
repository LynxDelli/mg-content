Content Build for the Metadata Games project

From https://gitorious.org/metadata/mgc.
Originally part of repository, https://gitorious.org/metadatagames.
Moved to github to note splitting metadatagames repo into Content and Game builds.

[Metadata Games](http://www.metadatagames.org/) is free and open source software (FOSS)
developed by [Tiltfactor Laboratory](http://www.tiltfactor.org/) at [Dartmouth College](http://www.dartmouth.edu/),
with funding from the [National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH)](http://www.neh.gov/) and the [ACLS](http://www.acls.org/).
