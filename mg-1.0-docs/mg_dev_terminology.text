Terminology
======================

Last Modified: 03/02/2012

### Subject Matter
MG categorizes images and users via subject matter (e.g. arctic or plants). 
Subject matter can be added and removed by editors. A default subject matter 
’all’, to which all user and image sets will be automatically assigned, is 
always present in the system. 

### Trust
For any user, trust can be saved on a per-image, based on a scale from 0 
to 100%. This will initially be set manually by an editor, but may later 
be automatically based on algorithms. Trust can be defined by plug-ins 
that calculates weightings.

### Expertise
Each user can have expertise in certain subject matters. An editor can 
configure the expertise of a user for a particular subject matter. 
Registered expertise can influence the weight of tags submitted by a 
user. At the moment, an editor will define expertise on a scale from 0 
to 100%. Expertise can be defined by plug-ins that calculate the score 
and weight of tags. 

### Interest
As with expertise and trust, interest will be stored in relation to subject 
matter defined in the system. The user will be able to define interest on a 
scale from 0 to 100%. Interest will be used by image plug-ins that weight 
image selection. 

### Tag
A tag is a keyword or short phrase associated with an image. A tag can contain 
alphanumerical letters and spaces. All other characters will be removed by the 
system before saving into the database. Tags can only exist in relation to an 
image. Each user contributed-tag will be annotated with a weight at time of 
recording. The weight of a user submitted tag is the outcome of a weighting 
by a weighting plug-in (e.g. high expertise for subject matter increased weight). 
This weight will influence the tag's importance by export or game play. A later 
change in the user’s expertise and/or trust will not influence the weight of 
already recorded tags.

### Tag Use
A tag use is the relation of a tag with an image. Each tag use is part of a 
submission for a games turn. Each tag use has a weight and will be marked as 
with a type. Tag uses can be linked to a player if the player has been 
authenticated. A tag use gains importance via its weight. A normal submission
of a tag for an image gets a weight of 1. This weight can be influenced by 
plugins or manually by an editor. These plugins can for example take trust, 
expertise, or interest in account. A tag use weight of 0 lets the system not 
count this tag use for further processing.   

### Image Set
An image set is a grouping mechanism for images. In MG version 1.0, each image 
in the system is assigned to only one image set. Images can be made available 
to games via image sets. Via each image set you can specify access rules, such 
as restricting image access to users with a certain IP address range. 

### Plug-in
MG makes use of a plug-in architecture to keep crucial parts of the system 
flexible. We use the Yii framework’s components to implement this architecture. 
Plug-in classes include: weighting of user-submitted tags, provision of access 
rules for image sets, import and export of images and tags, and dictionaries 
to extend MG with word-related functionalities.

### API
MG provides an application programming interface (API) to abstract all back end 
and database interactions needed to implement an arcade or game. Via the API, 
users will be able to login or register, change their profiles, and access and 
play games. The API enables MG not only to serve web based games, but to be 
structurally prepared to be used via mobile phone and/or tablet pc apps.
