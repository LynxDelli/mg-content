Metadata Games - Development Guidelines API Documentation
===========================

Last modified: 03/01/2012

Introduction
------------

The follwing document explains how to use the Metadata Games API. The API has 
been developped to allow the implementation of HTML(5), CSS, and JavaScript 
based games that will make use of the MG platform to facilitate the research 
in new ways of gathering keyword/tag information for large amount of images.

This document will explain all implemented API callbacks to support your
endevour in coding new or ammending existing games

API
---

As the whole system the API is implemented making use of the Yii framework. 
The API is a module that implements its functionality via controller and 
their actions. 

*To construct the url calling the API user http://(MG ROOT URL)/api/...*

While the current state of the API is implemented within two controller 
(User & Games) it will be here presented as one. You'll be able to distinguish
the controller by looking at the API callback URL.

API SECURITY / USED FILTER
--------------------------

To increase security the API makes use of several techniques and Yii action 
filter to enforce them and other. If you like to extend the API you will have
to make sure to set the needed filter or ammend the existing controller's filter
rules.

The API makes returns valid JSON and expects you to make all request via the 
browsers 'XMLHttpRequest' objects. E.g. with jQuery's $.ajax(...) calls. The
system checks the reqest if a HTTP header entry named *HTTP_X_REQUESTED_WITH*
exists and is set to *XMLHttpRequest*.

To increase security and make spoofing more complex the API expects you to 
retrieve a shared secret by sending a GET request to 
http://(MG ROOT URL)/api/user/SharedSecret and to sign all further request 
with the retrieved icon by adding a further header to your request. This header
should be called *HTTP_X_REQUESTED_WITH* and have the shared secret as a
value. 

*To simplify development we have developped a JavaScript API that offers many 
features and automatically attempts to retrieve the needed shared secret and 
signs the AJAX request with the needed headers. You can find the needed files
in /www/js/. Best to extend the base class that can be found in mg.api.js.*

*FILTER*

The API implementation makes use of the following filter:

- **throttle** making sure that the API can only be called in certain intervals. 
    Throwing 420 HTTP error if the client calls to fast (the sharedsecret call is 
    not throttled)'.
    
    HTTP STATUS ON FILTER TRIGGERED: 420
      
- **IPBlock** all API calls can be blocked for certain IP addresses by making use 
    of MG's IP block functionality.
    
    HTTP STATUS ON FILTER TRIGGERED: 403
    
- **APIAjaxOnly** all API request have to come as JavaScript GET or POST ajax request
    
    The filter will not throw an exception but redirect all non ajax traffic to the API
    modules default controller. Showing a short message that the API can only be consumed
    via AJAX requests
    
- **accessControl** some API callbacks might be using the Yii access control filter.

    HTTP STATUS ON FILTER TRIGGERED: 403
    
- **sharedSecret** as already mentioned with exclusion of the index and sharesecret 
    callbacks all requests have to be signed with an shared secret HTTP header
    
    HTTP STATUS ON FILTER TRIGGERED: 420

API SPECIFICATION 
-----------------

The following listing describes all implemented callback functions. And their 
behaviour in HTTP GET and/or POST requests. The development of the API aimed
to make the use of MG independent to the implementation of the arcade.

In general each API callback responses in JSON or throws exceptions coded with 
HTTP STATUSES. Each JSON respons includes a status field that can either be 'ok' 
or 'error'. In case of 'error' an additional field 'errors' might give more detailed
error information.

### */api/user/SharedSecret*

Returns a shared secret for the user that will be saved in the session. Each further 
request has to be signed with this shared secret. This should happen by setting the 
custom header *HTTP_X_MG_API_SHARED_SECRET* with the retrieved value

HTTP METHOD: GET

JSON:
<pre> 
  {
    "status":"ok",
    "shared_secret":"MG_API4f4fabdb05820p6tfh"
  }
</pre>
   
    
### */api/games/abort/played_game_id/(ID)/*

Attempts to retrive the played game identified by the current users session id and the 
given played game id to notifiy the opponent that the user has left the game.

This method is also used to skip the waiting for other player screen and play instantly
against the computer if the game does allow this option.
   
HTTP METHOD: GET

JSON: it will return {status:'ok'} or throws an HTTP 400 exception if the *played_game_id*
cannot be found. 
 
### */api/games/abort/AbortPartnerSearch/played_game_id/(ID)/*

Attempts to retrive the game_partner table entry identified by the given id. 
It it finds it. It will delete the set the row date to an 01/01/1970 and sends the other
user an abort message. If a second user should happen to be assigned to this id. 

HTTP METHOD: GET

JSON: it will return {status:'ok'} or throws an HTTP 400 exception if the *played_game_id*
cannot be found. 
 
### */api/games/abort/messages/played_game_id/(ID)/*

Returns messages for the user playing the given game identiefied by *played_game_id*

HTTP METHOD: GET

JSON: 
<pre>
{
  "status" : "ok" or "error",
  "messages" : [{message:'message 1'}, {message:'message 2'}, {message:'message 3'}, ...]
}
</pre>
   
### */api/games/abort/postmessage/played_game_id/(ID)/*

Attempts to retrive the played game identified by the current users session id and the given played game id to leave the posted message for the opponent. 
You have to make sure $_POST['message'] is set to the string you want to send to the other player. This message can be JSON. 

HTTP METHOD: GET

JSON: it will return {status:'ok'} or throws an HTTP 400 exception if the *played_game_id*
cannot be found. 
 
### */api/games/gameapi/gid/(GID)/played_game_id/(ID)/*

This method is a bridge between the api and game engines. It allows games to extend the api with further game specific functionality.

You have to make sure $_POST['call'] is set as this is required at the game engine to processs
the request. 

The JSON of call should be:

<pre>$_POST['call'] = {'method', 'name of method'}</pre>

You can optionally pass parameter by setting $_POST['parameter']

The minimum JSON of data should be:

<pre>
$_POST['parameter'] = {
 'parameter1', 'value', 
 'parameter2', 'value',
 ... 
}
</pre>

HTTP METHOD: POST

JSON:
<pre>
{
  "status" : "ok" or "error",
  "response" : ... // json generated by the game engine to be parsed by the game
}
</pre>

or throws an HTTP 400 exception if the *played_game_id* cannot be found. 
 

### */api/games/play/gid/(GID)/*
This method handels play requests into the system. It distinguishes between GET and POST requests. The GID 
is the unique id of a game (string).

#### GET

A GET requests is the initial call for a game. It prepares the needed database entries and provides 
the first turn's information. 

A GET Request might have to be repeated if the game is a two-player game and the player is forced to
wait for a second player. 

**Game Flow on Initialization**

<pre>
Call via GET request to /api/games/play/gid/(GID)/
  
If single player game 
    > send game data 
  
If two player game
  
1. Other player waiting 
    > send game data

2. No other player wating 
    > send 'retry' status
    
2.1 Try every 1 second for X seconds to find a partner

  2.1.1 If player found within the time 
      > send game data
      
  2.1.2 If after X seconds no partner has been found and game can be played against the computer 
      > send game data
      
  2.2 If game can be played against computer the player can skip the wait for partner by making 
      a call to */api/games/abort/AbortPartnerSearch/played_game_id/(ID)/* 
      the next time the game 'retries' to GET the system will 
      > send game data.  
</pre>

HTTP METHOD: GET

JSON: 

If two player and a second player is not available 

<pre>
{
  'status': 'retry'
}
</pre>

Or the game's initial data. **The data can vary for each game but you can 
assume that most of the fields listed below are available for all games.**  

<pre>
{
  status: 'ok|error',
  errors: {"field":["Error Message"]}, // if status == error
  game: {
    // the following fields are available in all games
    unique_id : '',
    played_game_id : '', // as a user can play more than one game per session we have to track a played game id
    name : '',
    description : '',
    more_info_url : '',
    base_url : '',
    'play_once_and_move_on' => '0|1', // if the game is a single player game
    'turns' => '4',
    'user_name' => null or 'user name' // if the user is authenticated
    'user_score' => 0 or x // if the user is authenticated
    'user_num_played' => 0 or x // if the user is authenticated how many times has the user finished this game  
    'user_authentiated => false/true // true if user is authenticated
    ... 
    //a game will list most likely have has more fields, e.g the custom settings
  },
  turn : {
    score : 0, // numeric of the previous turn's score
    tags : { //information of the previous turn's tags 
      "user" : [{
        "tag" : 'tag1',
        "original" : '', // set if submitted tag differs from registered tag (3 dogs -> three dogs)
        "score" : 1, // score of this tag
        "weight" : 1 
      },
      ...
      ],
      ...
      ]
    },
    // the following fields are available in all games
    images : [{
      // all urls are relative to game.base_url
      full_size : '',
      scaled : '',
      thumbnail : '',
 
      licences : [1,2,3] //id of licence(s) of the image that can be found in turn.licences,
      id : 1 // the id of the image in the database
    }, {...}],
 
    licences : [{
      id: '',
      name : '',
      description : '',
    }, {...}],   
    
    // the turn can have further elements created by plugins or similar. e.g
    wordsToAvoid : ["dog", "house", "car"],
  }
}
</pre>

or throws HTTP 400 exception if the *played_game_id* cannot be found.

or throws HTTP 500 exception if the could not be initialized.

#### POST

The games submit data as POST request. In the post request the users submission will be parsed, weightend, 
scored and stored in the database. The post method returns scoring results and the next turns information.

**Please make sure $_POST["turn"] is set with the following at least the following JSON**

<pre>
{
  turn : 2 // the current turn's number
  played_game_id : 1 // the id in the database representing that played game
  submissions : [{ // JSON of this turns submission. The shape of the JSON request differs per game it will most likely be
      image_id: //id of the image that has been tagged
      tags: //string of submitted tags
  }],  
  ... // you can add further values that are important for a particular game e.g. wordstoavoid
}
</pre>

This JSON will be parsed by the game API making use of the game engine's parseSumbission(...) implementation. 

Based on this the system will either respond either with the next turn **in form of the same JSON structure 
as the GET requests above** or if the system 

HTTP METHOD: POST

JSON: 

**In case of a two player game and the player is the first submitting one**

<pre>
{
  'status': 'waiting'
}
</pre>

This will lead the game to listen to the players message queue and repost the turn once the second
player who has been informed about the waiting first submittor submitted her turn. 

*OR*

In case of single player game, or second submittor, or re-submit after waiting time with the 
same JSON as the GET request above.  


or throws HTTP 400 exception if the played_game_id cannot be found.

or throws HTTP 400 exception if the submission cannot be parsed.

or throws HTTP 500 exception if the could not be initialized.

FURTHER NOT USED METHOD CALLS
-----------------------------

The following API calls are implemented but not currently in use. These and further
to be implemented API methods could be used to implement non web based application.
E.g. mobile phone apps making use of JSON calls to communicate with the server

### */api/games/*

    "user_score":0, // score of the authenticated player 
    "played_against_computer":false, // true if the game is played against a computer
    "user_authenticated":false, // true if user is authenticated
