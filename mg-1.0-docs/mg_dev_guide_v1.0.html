<h1>Metadata Games - Development Guideline</h1>

<p>Last modified: 03/02/2012</p>

<p>In the following we'll briefly explain the concepts and technology that
has been used to implement Metadata Games (MG). Please also refer to the 
<a href="mg_dev_terminology.html">terminology</a> document for clarification of a few
key terms.</p>

<h2>Yii Framework</h2>

<p>MG has been written in PHP with help of of the <a href="http://www.yiiframework.com/">Yii framework</a>.
As database we have choosen mySQL. </p>

<p>Yii is an model view control (<a href="http://www.yiiframework.com/doc/guide/1.1/en/basics.mvc">MVC</a>)
 framework and we kept for server site implementation strictly to that pattern. </p>

<p>We suggest that you familiarize yourself by browsing through the <a href="http://www.yiiframework.com/doc/guide/">The Definitive Guide to Yii</a>.</p>

<p>Make sure to know about the following key concepts of Yii 
before you go on with any deleopment for MG. </p>

<h2>Metadata Games System Architecture</h2>

<p>Please consult the following image for a overvie of the system architecture of MG.</p>

<p><img src="mg_dev_system_architecture_v1.0.png" style="width:800px" /></p>

<p>In the following we will briefly list how each of the sections has been implemented.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Arcade</strong></p>

<p>The arcade is implemented with controller, views, and several CPortlet widgets. It 
also makes use of the <em>user</em> module. The arcade and the widgets have been themed
using Yii's theming methods.</p>

<p>The code for the plugins can be found in /www/protected/controller,  /www/protected/components, 
/www/protected/models, /www/protected/views,  /www/themes</p></li>
<li><p><strong>API</strong></p>

<p>The API has been implemented as a module. Making use of several helper compontents. </p>

<p>The code for the plugins can be found in /www/protected/modules/api</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Games &amp; Game Engines</strong></p>

<p>Games are implemented as compontents and controller within the games module. Each 
game provides own assets but also uses the JavaScript API implementation provided
by MG. A game is consuming the API and will make use of weighting and dictionary 
plugins. All games makee use of several helper compontents. </p>

<p>The code for the plugins can be found in /www/protected/modules/games and /www/js</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Multiplayer Message Broker</strong></p>

<p>Has been developped as a callback function in the API. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Plugins</strong></p>

<p>MG has got a plugin architecture that has been implemented as module. At the moment 
five plugin categories are implemented as submodule of the plugins module:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Dictionary</em></p>

<p>Used by games to provide word lists (e.g. stop words, words to avoid) and to influence
tag use weighting.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Weighting &amp; Scoring</em></p>

<p>Used by games to weight tag uses and score game results.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Import</em></p>

<p>Can be used to implement further functionality on image import. E.g assign 
images to image sets. </p></li>
<li><p><em>Export</em></p>

<p>Used to provide additional functionality on export. E.g. embed tags into the
images' XMP headers.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Image Set Access (Not used in version 1.0)</em></p>

<p>Restrict access to image set based on certain creteria. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>The code for the plugins can be found in /www/protected/modules/plugins</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Database</strong></p>

<p>MG makes use of a MySQL as database. Yii, however, supports other databases the 
only potential constraint for using a different database management system is the 
install routine that uses a prefabricated SQL file to create all needed tables and 
their entries.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Backend</strong></p>

<p>The backend has been implemented as a module. Making use of several helper compontents.
Most of the admin tools have been initially generated with Gii (making use of custom 
templates) and then customized them further to meet the particular admin tools need. </p>

<p>The backend is basically a collection of admin tools implemented in the module but also
provides access to admin tools provided by other modules (e.g. the plugin setting or user
administration)</p>

<p>All admin tools are access restricted to be shown only to players of certain roles.</p>

<p><p>The code for the admin tool can be found in /www/protected/modules/admin</p></li>
</ul></p>

<h2>Games</h2>

<p>MG has been created to support the creation of games that help to create new 
keyword information (tags) for a large amount of images. As those games and 
their gameplay are unforeseen the system has to be very flexible. We'll 
describe in the following the how games can be implemented in MG. </p>

<h3>Game Types</h3>

<p>First of all it is worth to mention MG supports the following types of games:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Single Player</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Two Player</strong></p>

<p>Wherby two player games can be implemented to work in two modes:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Human vs. Human</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>Human vs. Computer</em></p>

<p>In case a second player is not available for a requested game or a
player does not want to play against another player, MG will try to 
simulate a human response based on existing information about the 
game, image sets, images, and tags.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>Game Structure</h3>

<p>Games are implemented as part of the <em>games module</em> (/www/protected/modules/games/).
Each game is consists of a component, a controller, and an folder containing 
all needed assets. Before we describe these element in detail it is worth to
mention that the games implementation is split in two parts. One part will
be rendered by the game's controller and served to the player to be executed 
in the users browser/client the other the game engine via the API on 
the server. </p>

<p>The browser side has the following tasks.</p>

<ul>
<li>Rendering of the needed HTML/CSS.</li>
<li>Provision of all needed assets (images, audio, etc.)</li>
<li><p>The game logic will be implemented as a JavaScript file an consume the 
API via AJAX calls. The responses of the API will be in JSON and parsed
by the game logic to render turns or continue the game play. </p></li>
<li><p>To ensure validity and security a game can only manipulate data in the
database via the API. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>The <em>game engine</em> is implemented as a component whichs predefined methods 
will be called by the API at certain states. At each of these states the 
game implementation can make use of the current games data, submission, 
states to process the data, create new turns, or save data to the database.</p>

<h3>Creating New Games</h3>

<p>To create a new game you'll have to implement a "game" package that fulfils 
the following tasks:</p>

<ul>
<li>Register game in MG</li>
<li>Provide interfaces to set needed variables for a game. </li>
<li>Provide the implementation of the server side game play making use of the API and the game engine.</li>
<li>Rendering of needed HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</li>
<li>Implementation of the needed client side JavaScript making use of a base library (provided).</li>
<li>Provide assets like CSS, images, and JavaScripts.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Once you have created a game and copied all needed files to the appropriate
folder on you MG install you'll have to visit the game admin tool in order to 
register the game as available in the system</strong></p>

<h3>Game Flow</h3>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Open Game in Browser</strong></p>

<p>This will call the game's controller which will render the needed HTML
and makes sure all needed CSS &amp; JavaScript will be loaded. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Initialize Game</strong></p>

<p>Once the page is loaded the JavaScript game logic (JGL) will make use of 
the API HTTP GET) to call the initial game data. This may need several 
attempts as the user may have to wait for a second player.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Render Turn</strong></p>

<p>Once the API returns the initial turn the JGL will render the needed 
HTML to allow the player to start the game. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Submit Turn</strong></p>

<p>The player finishs a turn by fullfilling certain criteria. The game logic
will then sends (HTTP POST) the turn to the API. This evaluates the submission
by making use of by an instatiation of the game's server side game engine. </p>

<p>If the submission is valid the API will interact with the <strong>game engine</strong> to
weight the tags from the submission, score the result, save the submission and 
tags and/or tag uses to the database and generated a new turn (if the game is 
not already over. The results and the new turn will be JSON encoded and 
send back to the client.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Parse Result</strong>  </p>

<p>The game logic will then parse the result and update the state of the client. 
This can involve task as rendering of the next turn, showing the last turn's
score, or showing a final screen if the game reaches the end. </p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Implementing a Game</h3>

<h4>IMPORTANT: the <strong>Game ID (GID)</strong> is the game's component class name without Game.</h4>

<p>As already said each game is a collection of a component, a controller, and at 
least a JavaScript file for the client side game logic implementation. We'll discuss 
these here now briefly. </p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Controller</strong></p>

<p>The controller's task is just to server the inital HTML needed to render the 
game. You should include all needed JavaScript and CSS. A new controller has to 
be place in /www/protected/modules/games/controller and name GIDController.php 
(e.g ZenTagController.php)</p>

<p>Within the HTML you should initialize the game logic and trigger it's init 
function.  </p>

<p>An example is the ZenTag controller which you can find here: 
/www/protected/modules/games/controllers/ZenTagController.php</p></li>
<li><p><strong>JavaScript Game Logic</strong></p>

<p>Each game logic is an extension of the MG GAME API which is an extension of 
the MG API implementation. Both files reside in /www/js/. By extending these
files you gain access to shared functionality and an simple interface to 
consume the API. As its complexity is hidden behind simple method calls. </p>

<p>The init call triggered via the HTML created by the controller cascades 
downward through the classes initialize all and then upward via success 
callbacks to start the game.  </p>

<p>An example of the implementation for the JavaScript based game logic is 
ZenTags that is in the following file /www/protected/modules/games/assets/zentag/js/mg.game.zentag.js</p>

<p>If you're implementing two player games you'll have to make use of the message 
provided by the API to pass important changes on to the other player as we're 
working with clients in distributed networks that (yet) cannot talk to each other 
in real time. Both clients have to poll this queue in short intervals to 
retrieve and act on these messages. </p>

<p>An exemplary implementation can be found in ZenPond's game logic file 
/www/protected/modules/games/assets/zenpond/js/mg.game.zenpond.js </p>

<p>Location: /www/protected/modules/games/assets/(game id in lowercase)/</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Game Engine</strong></p>

<p>Each game engine is a component that should be placed in /www/protected/modules/games/component.
It should be a class and file name GIDGame(.php) (e.g ZenTagGame.php). The class has
to extend MGGame and implement MGGameInterface. To ensure all expected 
methods are present and implemented. </p>

<p>While the methods inherited from MGGame might be only be partially be 
overwritten by own code. You'll have to implement the following methods as they
will differ which each games implementation:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>parseSubmission(...)</strong></p>

<p>As the JSON submitted/posted by the JavaScript implementation of the game 
can vary each game has to implement a parsing function to make it available
for the further methods. This is also the right place to sanity check the 
submission received by the server</p></li>
<li><p><strong>parseTags(...)</strong></p>

<p>Take the information from the submission and extract the tags for each image
involved in the current turn.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>setWeights(...)</strong></p>

<p>Allows to implement weighting of the submitted tags. Here you should usually 
provide hooks to the setWeight methods of the dictionary and weighting plugins.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>getTurn(...)</strong></p>

<p>Creates the needed data for a turn. This data will be passed on to the 
players client and there rendered. It will most likely involve the follwoing 
tasks. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>getScore(...)</strong></p>

<p>This method should hold the implementation that allows the scoring 
of the turn's submitted tags. It is the place to call the weighting 
plugin's 'scoring' methods. </p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>TIPPS</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Use jquery templates for the html of you clients. This makes the future
customization of your games much easier. </p></li>
<li><p>Don't forget you can extend the functionality of the API for a game by 
implementing a custom callback using the API's game api callback. </p></li>
<li><p>Have a look in the code there is many comments will help you to reveal further
functionality</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Please give the assets folder in the modules assets folder the name of the 
gameid in lowercase</strong> </p></li>
</ul>

<h2>API</h2>

<p>Please refer to the <a href="mg_dev_api_documentation_v1.0.html">API documentation</a> for more 
information on the current API's functionality and used security concepts implemented
as filter.</p>

<p>You can consume the API via AJAX JavaScript requests and it will repsond with data in
form of JSON encoded strings.</p>

<p>The API is implemented as a module which you can find in the /www/protected/modules/api 
folder. Here you can see that the API is actually no more than controller that extend 
an ApiController class to inherit base methods and filter. To add new functionality to 
the API you have either to implement new methods in the existing controller or add a
new controller. </p>

<p>At the moment the API's:</p>

<ul>
<li>User controller makes use of functionality implemented in the User module.</li>
<li>Games controller is more complex. It interact heavily with the database and instantiates
game engines to call their callback function at appropriate places.  </li>
</ul>

<p>For all API controller you want to make sure to keep using appropriate filter such as 
throttle, IPBlock, APIAjaxOnly, accessControl, and sharedSecret.</p>

<p>To allow two player games we implemented a server side message queue with wich help the 
game logic and API can leave messages for the two clients to trigger events on the remote
machines. </p>

<p>We recommend to make use of the JavaScript implementation of the API to consume the API
on client/browser side.</p>

<h2>Plugins</h2>

<p>To make it easier to extend certain functionalities of MG we have made use of 
a plugin architecture. At the moment the system make use of four categories of 
plugins. Which use and particular callbacks we will describe further down. </p>

<p>To begin with we want to explain how to implement a plugin. Each plugin will is
implemented as part of sub-modules of the plugins module extending components 
and models of the parent plugins module. If you have a look at the component
and models folder in /www/protected/modules/plugins folder you'll find the base
classes that you'll have to use. </p>

<p>A plugin consists of at least a component that you'll have to place in one of 
the sub modules component folder representing the plugin category. You can finde 
these here: /www/protected/modules/plugins/modules.</p>

<p>To ensure that each plugin of a category has all the callback methods of its 
category you'll have to extend the plugin's category componentent from the 
parent module. In your plugin you can overwrite all the inherited methods to 
suit your needs. </p>

<p><strong>Please make sure that the newly created component's class and filename end
in Plugin (e.g StopWordPlugin and StopWordPlugin.php)</strong></p>

<p>Once you've copied the files to the appropriate folders on your MG install visit
the plugin admin tool. Each time you visit the overview screen the system scans
the plugin folder and attempts to register/deregister plugins in the systems
database.</p>

<h3>Adding Plugin Settings Functionality</h3>

<p>If a plugin does not need any further settings you're good with just creating 
a component. To to store settings for a plugin you'll have to implement a model 
and a controller and place the code in the same sub-module folder. </p>

<p>All plugins share the same model which main task is to allow to save settings 
in the database and settings file. Please make sure to extend your plugins 
model with MGPluginModel and to implement the MGPluginModelInterface.</p>

<p>The controller can either be only consist of a sub</p>

<h3>Plugin Component Attributes</h3>

<p>There a few attributes you can set in the component to influence how MG is 
rendering the admin interfaces:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>enableOnInstall</strong></p>

<p>Set true to allow the plugin system to auto activate the plugin on registration.</p>

<p>Defaults to: FALSE;</p></li>
<li><p><strong>hasAdmin</strong>   </p>

<p>Set true if the plug-in has got an admin tool implemented by providing a 
controller.</p>

<p>Defaults to: FALSE;</p></li>
<li><p><strong>adminPath</strong>   </p>

<p>If the admin tools path is not the default location please specify it here. 
User absolute or relative paths. </p>

<p>Beware you might have to specify /index.php/ as part of your path if you use 
Yii routing</p>

<p>Defaults to: "";</p></li>
<li><p><strong>accessRole</strong>   </p>

<p>The minimum role needed in order to access the plug-ins admin tools</p>

<p>Defaults to: "editor";</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Plugin Categories</h3>

<p>As already described there are currently four plugin categories in use. Each 
of them serves a different purpose and might ask you to implement different 
methods that will be called throughout the system. </p>

<p><strong>Note: Please notice that most of the methods are empty stubs and that you'll 
have on to implement the methods that suit your particular need</strong>  </p>

<p>However some methods are share among all of them as all extend the same base
class MGPlugin. </p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>install()</strong> </p>

<p>Called on installation/registration of the plugin</p></li>
<li><p><strong>uninstall()</strong> </p>

<p>Called if you delete a plugin in the plugin admin tool.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>addScore(...)</strong> </p>

<p>This function adds a value to the score of a tag. If the key 
"score" is not set it will set it. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>adjustWeight(...)</strong> </p>

<p>This function adds or substracts a value from the weight of a tag.
If If the key "weight" is not set it will set it. Used by dictionary 
and weighting plugins.</p></li>
</ul>

<h4>Dictionary Plugins</h4>

<p>Used by games to provide word lists (e.g. stop words, words to avoid) and 
to influence tag use weighting.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>parseSubmission(...)</strong> </p>

<p>This handler allows dictionary plugins to contribute to the game 
submissions parsing</p></li>
<li><p><strong>lookup(...)</strong> </p>

<p>This is a callup that will allow you to check wether a list of tags are 
listed in the dictionary </p></li>
<li><p><strong>setWeights(...)</strong> </p>

<p>With help of this method you can influence the weight of tag submitted 
by the players. The weightened tags will be used for scoring and saved 
as tag uses into the database</p></li>
<li><p><strong>wordsToAvoid(...)</strong> </p>

<p>With help of this method you can add further elements to the words to 
avoid array returned the player in the turn's data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>add(...)</strong> </p>

<p>This function allows to add a tag to the dictionary. The $info provided 
can help a plugin to filter add requests.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Export &amp;</h3>

<p>Used to provide additional functionality on export. E.g. embed tags into the
images' XMP headers.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>form(...)</strong> </p>

<p>With help of this method you can add additional fields into the form. At 
a minimum you'll have to add a field that allows the user to activate the 
plugin for the current export.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>preprocess(...)</strong> </p>

<p>This method will be called at the moment the temporary folder has been created.
You could prepare files and folders needed for the processing of the images.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>process(...)</strong> </p>

<p>This method will be called once for each image to be exported.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>postprocess(...)</strong> </p>

<p>This method will be called after all images have been exported.</p></li>
</ul>

<h4>Import</h4>

<p>Can be used to implement further functionality on image import. E.g assign 
images to image sets. </p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>form(...)</strong> </p>

<p>Provides the ability to add additional fields to the form. Before it 
will be shown to the user. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>validate(...)</strong> </p>

<p>Callback handler for validation of the form fields added by the form method.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>process(...)</strong> </p>

<p>Callback handler that allows the plugin to process/manipulate the 
imported images.</p></li>
</ul>

<h4>Weighting &amp; Scoring</h4>

<p>Used by games to weight tag uses and score game results.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>addScore(...)</strong> </li>
</ul>

<p>This function adds a value to the score of a tag. If the key "score" is 
not set it will set it. </p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>score(...)</strong> </p>

<p>The method will be called to generate the score for one turn. 
Several weighting plugins can be called to built up a compound score. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>setWeights(...)</strong> </p>

<p>The method called by games to reweight any passed tags. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>parseSubmission(...)</strong> </p>

<p>This handler allows weighting plugins to contribute to the game 
submissions parsing</p></li>
<li><p><strong>addScore(...)</strong> </p>

<p>Helper Method: This function adds a value to the score of a tag. 
If the key "score" is not set it will set it</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>TAGS</h2>

<p>We'd like to highlight the MGTags class that streamlines the use of tags and the retrieval 
of tags of images in the system. You can find it in /www/protected/components and encurage 
strongly to make use of this class.</p>

<h2>Security in MG</h2>

<p>The security and validity of user profile data and user submissions is highly 
important. To ensure this MG is using the following security mechanism:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>To prevent a user from gaming or overloading the system, we restrict each 
user to a certain number of submissions in a certain amount of time, <br />
e.g., only one submission per 10 seconds. This is enforced via the 'throttle' 
action. The interval can be configured on the Global Settings page.</p></li>
<li><p>To deal with repeat offenders or malicious groups of users from a given IP 
range, we implemented a global black list of IP addresses. 
You can maintain this list via the admin tools.</p></li>
<li><p>You can block/deactivate player accounts</p></li>
<li><p>You have interfaces to set the tag use weight of a user or a tag to 0. </p></li>
<li><p>You have the ability to fine tune a players tag uses or ban the player alltogether. 
The system will automatically set all tag uses to 0. </p></li>
<li><p>Each registered player is identified by a unique id.</p></li>
<li><p>The API makes use of a session bound shared secret to make double submission 
from different client more difficult.</p></li>
<li><p>All user-submitted data is validated and sanitized on the server side before 
being added to the database to avert SQL injection and such like.</p></li>
<li><p>All user-submitted data will be sanitized before output to avoid wrong doing 
like XSS (cross site scripting).</p></li>
<li><p>To prevent misuse by anonymous users, each anonymous user is tracked in terms 
of time, IP address, and other session data in order to prevent misuse. The 
system is able to distinguish between contributions of different anonymous users.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>File Base Configuration Items</h2>

<p>To allow further development and update cycles we have made sure that configuration items 
and user data are clearly separated. All configuration items are stored in the file /www/protected/data/fbvsettings.php
which can be and is manipulated via the FBVStorage component. </p>

<h2>User Authentication &amp; Roles</h2>

<p>MG makes use of Yii's built in user authentication framework. Which is configured to 
use the database with help of the <a href="http://www.yiiframework.com/doc/api/1.1/CDbAuthManager">CDbAuthManager</a>
as storage place for the user authentication items. At the moment MG uses for roles
that Player, Editor, DB-Admin, Admin that are enforced throughout the sytem with inline
code in the view generating the menu items and as filter for actions. </p>

<p>One ideosyncracy of the current MG version is that the roles giving access to the admin 
tools are configured in the settings file that is located in /www/protected/data/fbvsettings.php.
For an overview over the role admin tool mapping please consult the document describing <a href="mg_guide_roles.html">Roles in MG</a>.</p>

<h2>Gii</h2>

<p>We have written several templates to for Gii to generate modules, models, controller, 
or views. We encourage you to use gii and giix shipped with this install to develop 
further admin tools or other backend sections.</p>

<p>We recommend to use . Please use the mg templates while 
creating models or CRUD code. If you generate CRUD code you can choose between two templates 
one for tables using created, modified columns and one for other models. Please generate all 
models representing actual database tables in the applications models (/protected/models/) 
folder this ensures easy reuse of these models.</p>

<h2>Further Development</h2>

<p>To allow further development and update cycles we have made sure that configuration items 
and user data are clearly separated. See "File Base Configuration Items" above and also 
allowed the usage of Yii Migrate. You can trigger the migration process from the terminal 
or via an admin tool if you are logged in as an administrator. </p>

<p>We have a few more suggestions for further development:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use Yii migrations to change the database from the V.1.0 scheme.</li>
<li>Use Gii to create quickly relyable admin tools</li>
<li>Use the JavaScript classes in /www/js/ (e.g. mg.api.js, mg.audio.js, or mg.tagdialog.js)
extended or as source for possible improvements for games or the admin tool</li>
<li>Make strictly use of the API to develop games. Don't invent new ways to consume rather 
extend the API's functionality</li>
<li>Please document/comment your work and amend the existing documentation where you see that 
it does not fit</li>
<li>Please follow the <a href="http://www.yiiframework.com/doc/guide/1.1/en/basics.convention">Yii Coding Conventions</a>, and 
keep everything as <a href="http://www.yiiframework.com/doc/guide/1.1/en/basics.best-practices">Model View Control as possible</a></li>
</ul>
